IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

1. PDF text extraction may not be perfect - some mnemonics might be in:
   - Images or diagrams
   - Special formatting that doesn't extract well
   - Tables or complex layouts

2. Some questions may have been created manually based on lecture content
   rather than being directly copied from slides

3. The concepts/keywords from most questions DO appear in the PDFs, even if
   the specific mnemonic acronyms don't

RECOMMENDATION:
===============

To ensure completeness, you should:
1. Manually review each PDF to verify all key concepts are covered
2. Check if any mnemonics appear in images/diagrams that weren't extracted
3. Verify that all important topics from the lectures have corresponding
   questions in your study cards

The fact that 62% of mnemonics weren't found suggests either:
- PDF extraction limitations
- Questions were created from lecture understanding rather than direct copying
- Some content may be missing
